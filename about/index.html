            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, beautiful souls! I'm Ramona, the heart and soul behind
              Beauty by Ramona. With a passion that blooms from the deepest
              roots of self-expression and wellness, I've embarked on a journey
              to share the transformative power of makeup, the healing essence
              of self-care, and the revolutionary act of self-love.
            </p>
            <p>
              I blog because I believe in the power of sharing, in the magic of
              connecting with others through stories, tips, and experiences.
              Every post I write is an open letter to anyone who’s ever felt
              lost in their skin, to those who are on a quest for inner peace,
              and to the brave souls who are on the journey of self-discovery.
              Through Beauty by Ramona, I aim to inspire, to encourage, and to
              remind each one of you that you are beautiful, worthy, and
              deserving of your own love and care.
            </p>

            <h2>Self-care & Self-love</h2>
            <p>
              Self-care is the intentional practice of taking action to preserve
              or improve one's own health. It's about finding moments of
              tranquility in the chaos of everyday life, whether through a
              skincare routine that makes you feel rejuvenated, a quiet walk in
              nature that clears your mind, or a meditation session that brings
              you peace. It's recognizing when you need a break and giving
              yourself permission to pause, without guilt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Self-love, on the other hand, is the deep-seated acceptance of who
              you are. It's about embracing your strengths and your flaws alike,
              and understanding that your worth is not defined by external
              achievements or the validation of others. Self-love is the
              foundation upon which self-care is built; it's what motivates us
              to nurture our well-being and pursue our happiness.
